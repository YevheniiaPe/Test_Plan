# Test Plan
## A test plan is a detailed document that describes the testing strategy, goals, schedule, evaluation, results, and resources required to test a software product. A test plan helps to define the approaches required to verify the quality of the application under test. 

Test plans are important documents. They help to ensure that the team works in a coordinated manner. They act as a guide and ensure that the final product is bug-free and meets the expected requirements. They also help others who are not part of the team understand the testing process. One of the important aspects of test plans is that they can be constantly changing and vary from product to product.
